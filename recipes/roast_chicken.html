    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way my grandmother used to make it. The method used in this recipe results in the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine, divided</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup baby carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Arrange the carrots, onion, and remaining celery around the chicken in the roasting pan. Sprinkle vegetables with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
